### Kadir
* Compression ratio
* Relative data redundancy (1-1/Cr)
* Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
* Mean-Square Signal to Noise Ratio (MS-SNR)
* Entropy
* and find more

### How to use
* ImageAssessment.fig -> UI file
* ImageAssessment.m   -> UI functions
* ./func              -> functions folder(add to path first)
* ./src               -> resources(include test img)
* Open application:
    - load image want to be assessed and original image(assessed image necessary, original image optional)
    - show or hide image display
    - assess

### References
> quick review of the functions, what it processes and how to understand result. add later

* MSE
* RMSE
* SNR
* PSNR
* MS-SNR
* Entropy

* Normalized Cross-Correlation
* Average Difference
* Structural Content
* Maximum Difference
* Laplacian Mean Square Error
* Normalized Absolute Error
* Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
    - Computation of three terms: luminance, contrast, structural
    - The overall index is a multiplicative combination of the three terms
